### Hello and Welcome 🌎

# About Me ☄️
My name is Jack Wilson, and I am an aspiring Frontend Web Developer. 🖥️
There won't be much on here for now, but I aim to change that in the coming months. I have been self-teaching myself as well as following online courses, expanding my knowledge. This has been turning into projects, and when they are finished, I will display more of them here!
