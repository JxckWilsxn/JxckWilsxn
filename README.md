Hello and Welcome 🌎
</p>

<h2 align"center">About Me ☄️</h2>
<p> My name is Jack, and I am an aspiring Frontend Web Developer currently located in Edinburgh, United Kingdom. 🖥️ </p>

<ul>
 <li>
 My programming journey consists of studying Software Development at university level as well as self-teaching myself in my free time. 
 Outside of University, I use Udemy courses and Frontend Mentor to build on my current knowledge and build my own responsive frontend projects. During my studies I have learned the basics such as HTML, CSS, and Javscript. I am on track and aim to learn about React, React Native, Typescript, and Vue to further increase my learning and workplace adaptability.
 </li>
 
 <li>
  I am fully open to collaborating on projects with others so please feel free to reach out. I have some experiance in frontend collaboration projects that I have done during my universal studies. I would like to get some experiance on working on a few of these outside of school!
 </li>

 <li>
  I also am very interested to hear from experianced developers about what is expected in a professional setting for a frontend developer and tips for how to boost myself in the current job market to actually get hired. Any advice on these types of topics I would be highly interested in to advance my knowledge in this part of my journey.
